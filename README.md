 Heather Gilbert ACC Resume Milestone Project.
 
 
 My project is aimed at current and future employers and so I have chosen to represent my current CV. 
 I have been a Clinical Coder for over 10 years and have used this project to showcase my working history and current skills, along with
 a bit about my personality and a way to contact me for more information.
 
 I will update this project and CV format in the future to represent my developer skills and projects. 
 
 
************UX**********
 
 This website is for potential employers, present and future, to see an overview of my skills and previous work experience and subsequently 
 be able to contact me to discuss projects and roles. 
 
 Any employers would want to see a candidate's previous work experience; be able to contact the candidate to enquire about the role they have;
 see the candidate's qualifications; to know a bit more about the candidate's personality and interests to gain further information about 
 whether they are suitable.
 
 My mock ups are included in this repository here /Mockups.jpg

 I am and whether they would want me on their team.
 

 When filling in the contact form, the user will not be able to submit if they have not filled out all of the required fields.

 Links to my CV and LinkedIn pages will open in a new tab in the web browser. These links have been manually tested. 
 This site was tested on multiple mobile devices and was found to be compatible and responsive on each. During testing, some of the menus and 
 photos needed to be adjusted. This was achieved using various media query functions.
